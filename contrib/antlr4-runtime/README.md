# antlr4-runtime
Subtree of antlr4 original repo

The branch `cpp-runtime-4.8` was created with commands:

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/antlr/antlr4.git
    git subtree split -P runtime/Cpp/runtime/src -b cpp-runtime-4.8 4.8
    git push origin cpp-runtime-4.8
    
No other original content is copied since it's too huge for submodule.
